# AVR-labs

## Purpose

This repository exists to make learning microcontrollers accessible to everyone, even without physical hardware.
Students can explore how a real microcontroller works using simulation before ever touching a board.
Arduino is used as a helpful tool, but not as a black box that hides how things really work.
Every program is built as real firmware, exactly as it would run on an ATmega328P.
The same code can be simulated or flashed, showing that software does not depend on a specific board.
By separating simulation, flashing, and labs, students learn how embedded systems are structured in practice.
The build system is designed to scale from simple exercises to larger projects.
Simulation allows learning in environments where hardware is unavailable or too expensive.
Each lab focuses on understanding, not just making something work.
The goal is not only to use microcontrollers, but to truly understand them.

# Labs

The labs are guided exercises designed to help you learn how microcontrollers work.  
The focus is on understanding and insight, not on speed or complexity.

## Microcontrollers

The labs are organised per microcontroller (MCU).  
Each microcontroller has its own characteristics, pin layout, and capabilities.

### ATmega328P
📍 `labs/atmega328p/`

This is the recommended microcontroller to start with.  
It is used in boards such as the Arduino Uno and is very well suited for education.

Recommended for:
- beginners
- first steps with microcontrollers
- learning about pins, ports, and timing

### Other microcontrollers
📍 `labs/<other-mcu>/`

Other microcontrollers may be present for comparison and further exploration.  
They are **not recommended as a first choice**.

## Where should I start?

If you are new or unsure where to begin:

➡️ Start with `labs/atmega328p/01-blink/`

This first lab shows how software can control a physical pin.  
No real hardware is required.

## Tools and projects

The labs make use of tools located in the `tools/` directory.  
You do not need to understand these tools in order to follow the labs.

For deeper exploration and experimentation, see the projects in the `projects/` directory.

# Labs

The labs are guided exercises designed to help you learn how microcontrollers work.
The focus is on understanding and insight, not on speed or complexity.

## Microcontrollers

The labs are organised per microcontroller (MCU).
Each microcontroller has its own characteristics, pin layout, and capabilities.

### ATmega328P
📍 `labs/atmega328p/`

This is the recommended microcontroller to start with.
It is used in boards such as the Arduino Uno and is very well suited for education.

Recommended for:
- beginners
- first steps with microcontrollers
- learning about pins, ports, and timing

### <Other MCU>
📍 `labs/<other-mcu>/`

This microcontroller is intended for comparison and further exploration.
It is **not recommended as a first choice**.

## Where should I start?

If you are new or unsure where to begin:

➡️ Start with `labs/atmega328p/01-blink/`

This first lab shows how software can control a physical pin.
No real hardware is required.

## Tools and projects

The labs make use of tools located in the `tools/` directory.
You do not need to understand these tools in order to follow the labs.

For deeper exploration and experimentation, see the projects in the `projects/` directory.

# Advanced topics

This section is intended for advanced learners who want to explore microcontrollers beyond the standard learning paths.

The topics covered here are optional and are not required to complete the core labs.  
They are meant for learners who are curious about what happens when source code is not available, or who want to study firmware at a lower level.

These materials focus on understanding, not on bypassing protections or analysing proprietary software.

---

## What you will find here

- Tools to study existing firmware images  
- Analysis of compiled `.elf` and `.hex` files  
- Exploration of firmware structure and memory layout  
- Low-level inspection of microcontroller behaviour  

---

## Intended audience

This section is suitable for learners who already have experience with:

- microcontroller architecture  
- assembly language  
- memory and execution flow  

Guidance from a teacher or mentor is strongly recommended.

---

## Educational scope

All activities in this section are intended for educational purposes only.  
No proprietary firmware is provided, and learners are expected to work with their own code or with openly available examples.

Understanding compiled firmware is a valuable skill in embedded systems education and research.

Proceed at your own pace.  
This section exists to satisfy curiosity and deepen understanding.

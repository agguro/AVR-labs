## Labs and simulation

The core of this repository consists of hands-on labs built around real firmware and simulation.

- 🔬 Labs are organised per microcontroller and topic  
- ⚙️ Each lab can be **simulated** or **flashed**  
- 🧠 The focus is on understanding how things work internally  

Simulation makes it possible to learn even when hardware is unavailable.

# How to use this repository

This repository can be used in different ways, depending on age, experience, and available resources.  
There is no single correct path. The goal is to choose an approach that fits the learner.

The sections below describe four common ways to use this repository.

---

## Option 1 — Just get started

This option is intended for learners who want to try something quickly, without worrying about tools or setup.

- Uses simple Arduino sketches  
- Works with the Arduino IDE  
- No build system or terminal required  

This approach is suitable for younger learners, or for situations where close guidance is available.  
It allows students to see immediate results and build confidence.

---

## Option 2 — Learn how it works (recommended)

This option focuses on understanding how a microcontroller behaves internally.

- Uses simulation instead of physical hardware  
- Does not require an Arduino board  
- Allows safe experimentation  

This is the recommended path for learning, especially in educational environments or where hardware is limited.  
Simulation makes it possible to observe and understand behaviour without risk.

---

## Option 3 — Build and explore

This option is for learners who want to go deeper and understand how firmware is built.

- Uses a build system  
- Produces real firmware files  
- Introduces project structure  

This path is suitable for older students or those with some programming experience.  
It helps learners understand how larger embedded projects are organised.

---

## Option 4 — Use real hardware

This option is intended for learners who want to work with physical microcontrollers.

- Uses a flashing tool  
- Writes firmware directly to the microcontroller  
- Explains what “uploading” really means  

This path connects the software to real hardware and shows how tools communicate with devices.

---

These options are not exclusive.  
Learners can move between them as their understanding grows.

The purpose of this repository is not just to make things work,  
but to understand why they work.
